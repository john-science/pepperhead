# PepperHead

> Hot Sauce Reviews


## Why does this site exists?

1. I love hot sauce.
2. I want to try out Vue.js.


## Educational Notes

#### Vue.js

Well, it's that time again:

> Time to learn another JavaScript Framework.

#### Multi-Page Vue.js Apps

This was more work than in needed to be. And very poorly documented on the vue.js site.

I (loosely) followed the example [here](https://github.com/chriscalo/vue-multipage).
